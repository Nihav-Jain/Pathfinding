7. Select a node and then click "Set as Dest" button to mark that node as the Destination node (RED) for the pathfinding
8. Click on an edge to select it and then use the "Edge Weight" text box to update its weight. Click on "Save Weight" to save the updated weight value.
9. Load a .graph file from the content folder by clicking on the "Load Graph" button
10. Click on "Save" button to update a loaded file
11. Click on "Save as" button to save the current graph in a separate file
